# Arduino/Labview Joystick Interface
The purpose of this project was to develop a LabVIEW interface to an analog joystick using the LINX library for Arduino.
## Hardware
The joy stick is a thumb controlled 2 axis unit with a push to select feature. The Joystick was built using the [Adafruit Joystick](https://www.adafruit.com/product/512) breakout board kit. Wires were soldered to the breakout board in lieu of a header.
